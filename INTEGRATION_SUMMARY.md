- **Implementation priorities** defined
- **Technical explanations** for each change

### 4. ✅ **Conversion Factor REST API**
- **FastAPI-based** with automatic documentation
- **Advanced search capabilities** by scope, category, units, value ranges
- **Pagination support** for large result sets
- **Quick lookup endpoints** for common factors
- **Major changes API** for tracking year-over-year updates
- **Health monitoring** endpoints
