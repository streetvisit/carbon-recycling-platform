# Module 4: Decarbonisation & Reduction Planner - Complete

## üéâ Module Overview

Module 4 transforms the CarbonRecycling.co.uk platform from analysis to action by enabling users to create, model, and track specific emission reduction initiatives. This module answers the critical question: "What should we do about our emissions?"

## ‚úÖ Completed Components
