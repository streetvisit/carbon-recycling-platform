## ðŸŽ¯ Outstanding Items

### Future Enhancements (Not Critical for Launch)

#### AI Chat Agent (Backlogged)
**Status:** Future consideration  
**Reason:** Requires significant integration work and ongoing API costs  
**Notes:**
- Would require integration with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Needs robust context management and session handling
- Ongoing per-query costs
- Better suited for post-launch feature based on user demand

**Recommendation:** Monitor user feedback post-launch to determine if this feature would provide sufficient ROI
