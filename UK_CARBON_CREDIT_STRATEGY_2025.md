  async validateIntegrityPrinciples(@Body() creditData: any) {
    // Validate against UK's 6 principles

export class UKRegistryIntegrationService {
  
  // UK Voluntary Carbon Registry
  async connectToUKRegistry(): Promise<RegistryConnection> {
    // Implementation when UK registry APIs available
  }

}
```

## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

### **Ring-Fenced Development Strategy**

Since you want a fully working system ring-fenced for development:

```bash
# Create UK Development Environment
mkdir uk-carbon-development
cd uk-carbon-development

# Environment Variables for Development Mode
cat > .env.development << EOF
NODE_ENV=development
UK_COMPLIANCE_MODE=true
RING_FENCED=true
REAL_TRADING_DISABLED=true
SIMULATION_ONLY=true
UK_REGISTRY_SANDBOX=true
VCMI_TEST_MODE=true
CCP_VALIDATION_TEST=true
EOF

# Development Database Configuration
cat > database.dev.config.ts << EOF
export const devConfig = {
  // Use separate development database
  database: 'carbon_platform_uk_dev',
  // Enable extensive logging for development
  logging: true,
  // Enable debug mode
  debug: true,
  // Ring-fence from production
  production: false,
};
EOF
```

### **Development Safeguards**
```typescript
// Development Mode Interceptor
@Injectable()
export class DevelopmentModeInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    
    // Block real financial transactions in development
    if (this.isRealMoneyTransaction(request)) {
      throw new ForbiddenException('Real money transactions disabled in development mode');
    }
    
    // Add development headers
    request.headers['X-Development-Mode'] = 'true';
    request.headers['X-UK-Compliance-Test'] = 'true';
    
    return next.handle();
  }
}
```
